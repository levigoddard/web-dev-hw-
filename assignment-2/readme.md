In this particular assignment I decided to go through the tutorial twice before even starting the assignment. I did this to make sure I understood the material better and to understand the issues I had creating the files needed. I utalized google more than anything to find solutions to my computer not giving me access to files I created. I ended up having to recreate them on a different device.
